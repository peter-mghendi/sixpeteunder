### Hi there 👋

I'm Pete. Trying to fix bugs on the grandest scale 🌍

While you're here you should look at:
- [3k](https://3k.netlify.app) - Progressive Web Application that provides you with information on upcoming Marvel features.
- [Karata](https://karatagame.herokuapp.com) - Real-time, multiplayer Kenyan street poker over websockets.
- [Squanch](https://squanch.netlify.app) - Rick and Morty encyclopaedia as a Single Page application.
- [Noticebord](https://noticebord.herokuapp.com) - Noticeboard-as-a-Service.
- [Maseno CU](https://masenocu.org) - Maseno Christian Union website.

## I'm currently building:

### Enigma  

A Web 2.0 application that utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques to enable automated transaction fraud detection, streamlining of public procurement processes and safe, anonymous whistleblowing.

> 🥇 Enigma took first place nationally in the 2021 UNODC Coding4Integrity hackathon and was presented at the ninth session of the Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (13th - 17th December, Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt).

### Karata

A real-time, online multiplayer implementation of Kenyan street poker, based on [ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net), [SignalR](https://signalr.net) and [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

> 🎮 Karata is online and currently undergoing closed beta testing. Expect a public launch sometime soon!

### Zua

A multi-tenant Web 2.0 Software-as-a-Service application aimed at simplifying, streamlining and anonymizing Customer-to-Business feedback processes.

> 🕵️ Zua is directly based on lessons learned while building Enigma, to make feedback truly anonymous.
