### Hi there 👋

I'm Pete. Trying to fix bugs on the grandest scale 🌍

## I'm currently building:

### Enigma  

A Web 2.0 application that utilizes Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning Techniques to enable automated transaction fraud detection, streamlining of public procurement processes and safe, anonymous whistleblowing.

> 🥇 Enigma took first place nationally in the 2021 UNODC Coding4Integrity hackathon and was presented at the ninth session of the Conference of State Parties to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (13th - 17th December, Sharm El-Sheikh, Egypt).

### Karata

A real-time, online multiplayer implementation of Kenyan street poker, based on [ASP.NET Core](https://asp.net), [SignalR](https://signalr.net) and [Websockets](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API).

> 🎮 Karata is online and currently undergoing testing. Expect a public launch sometime soon!
